 *  Course: Princeton: Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose
 *
 *  Compilation: javac Birthday.java
 *  Execution: java Birthday n trials
 *
 *  Purpose: This is a program that takes two integer command-line arguments n
 *  and trials and performs the following experiment, trials times:
 *  Chooses a birthday for the next person, uniformly at random between 0 and nâˆ’1.
 *  Have that person enter the room. If that person shares a birthday with someone
 *  else in the room, stop; otherwise repeat. Suppose that people enter the room
 *  one at a time.
 *
 *  In each experiment, it counts the number of people that enter the room.
 *  It prints a table that summarizes the results (the count i, the number of times
 *  that exactly i people enter the room, and the fraction of times that i or
 *  fewer people enter the room) for each possible value of i from 1 until the
 *  fraction reaches (or exceeds) 50%.
 *
